  Imagine, if you will, walking through a city-scape of crystalline
buildings, with a passing scent of burning ozone in the air, minding your own business,
only to carelessly step around a blind corner to find yourself face-to-face
with a crackling raiche-blade to you throat, and a (Darchen energy rifle) to your back?

  What do the Darchen, and the Arketchi surrounding me have to do with my ultimate
situation? Perhaps dear listener, we need to step back in time a bit.
